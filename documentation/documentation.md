# Skärgården

## Goal of the game

The Swedish state has hired you to chart the archipelage. You contracted people to scout out all the islands, but they took off with the money leaving you with only loose clues as to where the islands are. Maybe you can somehow use these hints to finalize the sea charts?

## The chart

At the start of the game, you will be given a new chart. It will look like this:

Your objective is to colour in all the tiles that are white, using the hints in the headers and the legend. A finished chart will look something like this:

Notice that each number in the headers match the number of land tiles in the respective row/column, and that each island shape in the legend is represented the correct number of times in the chart.
