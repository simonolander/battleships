# Skärgården

## Goal of the game

The Swedish state has hired you to chart the archipelage. You contracted people to scout out all the islands, but they took off with the money leaving you with only loose clues as to where the islands are. Maybe you can somehow use these hints to finalize the sea charts?

## The chart

When you start a new chart, it will look something like this:

Your objective is to colour in all the tiles that are white. A finished chart will look something like this:
